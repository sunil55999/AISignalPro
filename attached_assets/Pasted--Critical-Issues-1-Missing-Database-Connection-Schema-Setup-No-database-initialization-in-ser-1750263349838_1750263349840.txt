üêõ Critical Issues
1. Missing Database Connection & Schema Setup
No database initialization in server/storage.ts
Missing Drizzle ORM setup and connection
Schema definitions exist but aren't being used
2. Incomplete Storage Implementation
server/storage.ts uses in-memory Maps instead of database
Methods like getSignalsByDateRange are incomplete
Database queries aren't properly implemented
3. Frontend API Integration Issues
React Query setup exists but many components don't use it
API calls in components bypass the centralized API client
Inconsistent error handling across components
4. Missing Core Dependencies
Database driver not properly configured
React Query types missing
shadcn/ui components incomplete
‚ö†Ô∏è Major Issues
5. Python Core Modules Not Integrated
Advanced parser in core/parser/ isn't connected to the main system
MT5 dispatcher in core/mt5_bridge/ is isolated
OCR processor and Telegram listener exist but aren't used
6. File Path Issues
Hardcoded Windows paths in MT5 EA (C:\TradingSignals\)
Cross-platform compatibility problems
Signal file creation logic missing
7. User Settings Infinite Loop
Console logs show excessive PUT/GET requests to /api/user/1/settings
Likely caused by state management issues in React components
Performance impact from repeated API calls
8. Authentication & Authorization Missing
No user authentication system
Admin panel has no access control
All endpoints are publicly accessible
üîß Minor Issues
9. Component State Management
Several components have unused state variables
Props drilling instead of proper state management
Missing loading states and error boundaries
10. TypeScript Errors
Inconsistent type definitions
Missing type imports
Any types used instead of proper typing
11. Signal Processing Logic
Manual rule checking in parser has async issues
Confidence calculation inconsistencies
Duplicate signal prevention not working properly
12. MT5 EA Integration
JSON parsing in MQL5 is basic and error-prone
File reading frequency too high for production
Error handling in EA is minimal

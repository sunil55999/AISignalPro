✅ 4. Improved Layout & Navigation
Upgrade	Description

🗺️ Guided Mode	Breadcrumbs or “wizard” flow in Beginner setup
🧱 Tabbed Views	Use tabs for: Overview / Parsing / Advanced per signal
🖼 Visual Confirmation	Add preview card showing parsed result + original message/image

✅ 5. Bug Fixes to Address
Issue	Fix
⚠️ Parser low-confidence but trade still sent	Add global block if confidence < 0.85
⚠️ Signal duplicates on reconnect	Add hash of channel + message_id to check
⚠️ UI shows outdated signals	Use WebSocket or polling refresh on each tab
⚠️ Image OCR sometimes fails silently	Add fallback + red icon if OCR failed
⚠️ EA not picking up new signals	Add file-locking, checksum, retry loop

✅ 6. Quality-of-Life Upgrades
🔹 UX
Tooltips for each action

Responsive mobile version

✅ 7. Upgrade Execution Logic
Upgrade	Reason

✅ Execution delay randomizer	To avoid patterns
✅ Partial close support	Split exits by % or price
✅ Execution mode: shadow / semi-auto / auto	Beginner mode = semi-auto default

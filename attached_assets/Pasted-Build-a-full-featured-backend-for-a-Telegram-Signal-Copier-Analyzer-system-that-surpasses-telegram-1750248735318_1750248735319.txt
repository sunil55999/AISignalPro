Build a full-featured backend for a Telegram Signal Copier & Analyzer system that surpasses telegram-signals-copier.com in performance, intelligence, safety, and customization.

🎯 OBJECTIVE
Design a secure, scalable, modular backend API that:

Processes Telegram messages from 100+ channels in real-time

Passes each message through an AI signal parser or manual rule system

Outputs clean structured trades to be consumed by:

MT5 EA runner (via JSON/sockets)

User dashboards

Admin audit logs

Supports multi-user sessions, channel control, signal performance scoring, and retraining/updating the AI parser

📚 KEY MODULES TO DEVELOP
1. Message Ingestion Module
Responsibilities:

Receive real-time messages from userbot or Webhook

Store raw message content in database

Attach metadata (timestamp, channel name, user ID, etc.)

APIs:

http
Copy
Edit
POST /messages/new
{
  "message_id": 123,
  "channel": "@XAUUSDChannel",
  "content": "Buy Gold now SL 1980 TP 1995",
  "media_url": null
}
2. AI Signal Parser Engine
Responsibilities:

Feed messages into trained AI parser or OCR pipeline

Fallback to manual rule engine if confidence < threshold

Return structured JSON for trading

Internal Use Only:

python
Copy
Edit
{
  "pair": "XAUUSD",
  "action": "buy",
  "entry": 1985.0,
  "sl": 1980.0,
  "tp": [1995, 2000],
  "intent": "open_trade",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "source": "ocr"
}
3. Trade Dispatcher
Responsibilities:

Push structured trade data to MT5 bridge (file, socket, or local API)

Enforce per-user risk, filters, and account settings

Queue or block if signals are conflicting or duplicate

Signal Output Format for EA:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "symbol": "XAUUSD",
  "action": "buy",
  "entry": 1985,
  "sl": 1980,
  "tp": [1995, 2005],
  "lot": 0.2,
  "order_type": "market"
}
4. Admin Control System
Responsibilities:

Enable/disable channels, users, or providers

Upload custom rules, set parser confidence levels

Trigger retraining or override AI result

View signal logs and trade execution reports

APIs:

POST /admin/rules/upload

GET /admin/trades/logs

POST /admin/parser/retrain

PATCH /user/:id/toggle

5. User Control + Settings
Responsibilities:

Allow user to:

Enable/disable signal copier

Add/remove channels

Adjust risk settings, lot size, trade filter

View parsed signals and trade history

APIs:

POST /user/settings

GET /user/signals

GET /user/alerts

6. Rule-Based Parsing Engine
Responsibilities:

Custom per-user or per-channel rules

If message contains "SL to BE", return:

json
Copy
Edit
{ "intent": "modify_sl", "sl_to_be": true }
Stored in JSON or DB format

Editable via Admin Panel

7. Performance Tracker & Signal Scoring
Responsibilities:

Analyze historical signals and trade results

Score providers by:

Hit rate (TP vs SL)

Average RR

Execution latency

Output weekly/monthly reports

APIs:

GET /stats/providers

GET /stats/user/:id/performance

🧰 TECH STACK RECOMMENDED
Layer	Tool
Backend Framework	FastAPI (or Flask if preferred)
Database	PostgreSQL (or SQLite for MVP)
Signal Parser	Internal AI model + spaCy/Transformer
OCR for image input	PaddleOCR / EasyOCR
MT5 Bridge	JSON socket output or local file
Auth + Admin	JWT / OAuth + Flask-Admin / Replit CMS
Scheduler	APScheduler / Celery (for reports/retraining)

🔐 SECURITY & PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
Concern	Strategy
User signal isolation	Per-user API key or session tracking
Trade duplication	De-dupe by message ID + time window
Command spoofing prevention	Only accept data from trusted scraper
Admin override safety	Log every change in audit table
Parser sandboxing	Run inference in separate thread/process

🧠 SCALABILITY ROADMAP
Phase	Features Added
✅ Phase 1	Parsing + MT5 Execution + Logs
🔄 Phase 2	Admin panel, rule engine, multi-user
🔁 Phase 3	Performance scoring + backtesting
📈 Phase 4	Auto-training with feedback + alerts
